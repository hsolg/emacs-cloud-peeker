** Using MELPA

1. Ensure MELPA is added to your package archives:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'package)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
   (package-initialize)
   #+end_src

2. Install ~weather-scout~:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (package-install 'weather-scout)
   #+end_src

3. Configure the package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package weather-scout
  ;; Enable auto-loading (redundant if the command is bound to a key below)
  :commands (weather-scout-show-forecast)
  ;; Add key binding (optional)
  :bind (("C-c w" . weather-scout-show-forecast)))
#+end_src

** Using Doom Emacs

1. Add ~weather-scout~ to your ~packages.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! weather-scout :recipe (:host github :repo "hsolg/emacs-weather-scout"))
#+end_src

2. Sync Doom packages:

#+begin_src shell
doom sync
#+end_src

3. Restart Emacs or run ~M-x doom/reload~.

4. Configure the package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! weather-scout
  ;; Enable auto-loading
  :commands (weather-scout-show-forecast)

  :init
  ;; Add key binding (optional)
  (map! :leader
        :desc "Show weather forecast"
        "z w" #'weather-scout-show-forecast)

  ;; Use Vim motions in the weather forecast buffer (optional)
  (with-eval-after-load 'evil
    (evil-set-initial-state 'weather-scout-mode 'motion)))
#+end_src

* Usage

The command weather-scout-show-forecast displays weather forecast for a selected
location from MET Norway. The first time the command is invoked, it will display
a search prompt in the minibuffer. The next time it is invoked, it will remember
the previous selection. To select a new location, invoke the command with a
prefix argument (typically C-u) to display the search prompt again.

Location searches use the free GeoNames service. By default, weather-scout uses
its own GeoNames account. Because of rate limits, creating you own account is
recommended. Follow the steps below to create and configure your own account.

- Create a free account here: https://www.geonames.org/.
- Enable the new account for the free webservices on the account page:
  https://www.geonames.org/manageaccount.
- Set this variable in your Emacs configuration:
  =(setq weather-scout-geonames-account-name "your-account-name-here")=
